## What is @ng-frrri/nest-crud <a id="what-is-frrri-nest-crud"></a>

**@ng-frrri/nest-crud** is simplifying CRUD controllers in NestJS.

We believe your CRUD controllers should use a singleton service for it's communication layer. This way @ng-frrri/nest-crud is easily extensible with any type of backend service, be it a database or a secondary api you consume.

For this, we have created two implementations so far:

* ​[@ng-frrri/nest-crud-mongoose](https://github.com/bitflut/frrri/tree/master/libs/nest-crud-mongoose)​
* ​[@ng-frrri/nest-crud-json-server](https://github.com/bitflut/frrri/tree/master/libs/nest-crud-json-server)​

Until documentation catches up, please have a look at tests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitflut/frrri/tree/master/libs).
