# Introduction

## 🏎🏎🏎🏎

**FRRRI** \(the racing car\) is a collection of libraries for Angular and Nest to simplify CRUD communication. The **@ng-frrri/ngxs-crud** library is ready for preview now.

They can be used together or separately with any other frontend or backend implementation. They are built to be highly flexible and easily extensible.

## @ng-frrri/ngxs-crud

We suggest reading through the [Usage chapter](ngxs-crud/usage/) in order to understand all basic intentions of @ng-frrri/ngxs-crud.

See [Quick start](https://github.com/bitflut/frrri/tree/4b5441257b908b39c2d218c6c34e711caa1afbf9/docs/ngxs-crud/quick-start.md) for minimal setup instructions.

## @ng-frrri/nest-crud

Browse GitHub repository and tests until documentation catches up.
