# Installation

To use @ng-frrri's Ngxs integration you need to install the following packages.

```bash
# @ng-frrri/ngxs
npm install @ng-frrri/ngxs --save

# dependencies
npm install @ngxs/store @ngxs-labs/data --save
```

In addition to applying operators to your routes, you usually want to define some repository your app talks to. For now we have integrated http support for @ng-frrri/ngxs.

```bash
# @ng-frrri/ngxs-http
npm install @ng-frrri/ngxs-http --save
```
